# QR-Code_Generator
This is code that can be used to generate a qr code in the terminal. First when downloading the files, pull them into vs code, make sure you are in the folder directory and run npm i to install all dependencies that are required. Once that's done, run the index file through node index.js and the project should prompt you to enter a url.
